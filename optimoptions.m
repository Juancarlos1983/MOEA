function [ opt ] = optimoptions( varargin )
%optimoptions Octave only! - Sets a simple setting for the root-finding
%method. An equivalent to Matlab's optimoptions is not (yet) available in
%Octave, and this function ensures the code still works.
%
% NOTE: this is NOT an Octave implementation of Matlab's optimoptions. DO
% NOT INCLUDE this file with MARRMoT's Matlab distribution because Matlab
% will preferentially use this file instead of its own built-in 
% optimoptions.
